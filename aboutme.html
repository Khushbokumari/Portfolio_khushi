        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr />
        <p>One of my biggest strength is that I am a team player. It is a skill that I picked up in school as a member of Sports team. I enjoy working in teams and have been often told by both supervisors and peers that I am the motivator of the group during stressful situations.
            In college, during a group presentation, one of the team members did not submit his bit of work. Given the short deadline, everybody was worried. Analyzing the situation, I called for a short meeting. I asked everyone to take equal parts of the unfinished business and we managed to hand in a great presentation.
            My biggest weakness is that at times, my communication style can be blunt and harsh. Hence, I am learning to reserve my judgment and write down my blunt criticism before I say it aloud. This has allowed me to communicate well and build strong professional relationships.Achievement wise, I am proud of several accomplishments.I feel my greatest academic achievement would be the successful completion of my MCA degree with a 8.95 CGPA. In my academic achievement genre again, I would also like to mention that I got 59.9% in my XIIth board and 85.5% in my Xth board, which I feel are also are academic achievements.
            Also, in the professional achievement sphere, I contributed substantially to one topic(s) my project work(s) like Android app on student notification.Unlike few of my peers, I am skilled in C,Java,HTML,Python,CSS,JavaScript,Nodejs,Angular,Maven.I tag all of them as my achievements as in each one of them I demonstrated my proficiency, teamwork,leadership and solved challenges. I hope to add many more feathers in my cap in coming years.
            I have always believed that internships enables one to gain first-hand exposure of working in the real world. It also allows students to harness the skill, knowledge and theoretical practice they learnt in university. It teaches young professionals about the specific industries and companies they are interested in.
            I got an opportunity to intern with a Zoxima SolutionPvt Ltd where i assign as a D365, powerapps developer intern .
            Academic Projects are a great way to understand the subject better and get a practical experience. It gives a chance to showcase our skills and also learn about team work, communication and responsibilities.
            Further on, I would like to mention about my Project I worked on Prince pipe during internship 
            Having said that, I would like to mention that Iâ€™m really excited about this opportunity because I think it will give me the right exposure and develop my skills further</p>
